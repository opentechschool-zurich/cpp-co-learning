Four numbers plus three operators (+,-,*,/) between them must get a defined result

example: 

numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4 
result: 24
solution: 1 * 2 + 3 * 4 = 24

Part a:
Make a program that gets four numbers and the result and prints the first solution

Part b:
Extend the program to 100 random numbers and a result and print all the solutions
